# Design System Grid

## Developing
Run `yarn install` and `grunt serve` to spin up a grid tester file located in the test folder.

## Usage

The grid is a simplified version of what you might find in other UI libraries like Bootstrap. Use it to help you define your page structure. It spans 100% width of its parent container and is comprised of `<div>` elements.

The grid is made up of rows and columns. The following example will create a grid with 2 rows; the first with 2 columns, and the second with 3 columns:

```js
<div class="ds-grid">
  <div class="ds-grid__row">
    <div class="ds-grid__col">Some content</div>
    <div class="ds-grid__col">More content!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="ds-grid__row">
    <div class="ds-grid__col">More stuff goes here</div>
    <div class="ds-grid__col">There are three columns in this row</div>
    <div class="ds-grid__col">Here's the third</div>
  </div>
</div>
```
### Rows

- Children of `ds-grid` and parents of columns (you may also nest them inside higher-order columns without redefining a new grid)
- No padding or margins
- Stretch to 100% width of the grid

### Columns

- Direct children of rows
- No padding or margins
- Stretch to the width of their content


#### Adjusting Width

`width-{some-fraction}`

Apply different widths to your columns by adding a width modifier (represented in fractions). Keep in mind, if you alter the width of a column, you must also apply the correct modifiers to its siblings so their collective widths = 1.

**The following example outlines possible combinations of width modifiers (4 is the max amount of columns):**
```js
    <div className="ds-grid">
      <div className="ds-grid__row">
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-half">1/2</div>
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-half">1/2</div>
      </div>
      <div className="ds-grid__row">
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-third">1/3</div>
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-third">1/3</div>
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-third">1/3</div>
      </div>
      <div className="ds-grid__row">
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-third">1/3</div>
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-two-thirds">2/3</div>
      </div>
      <div className="ds-grid__row">
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-fourth">1/4</div>
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-fourth">1/4</div>
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-fourth">1/4</div>
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-fourth">1/4</div>
      </div>
      <div className="ds-grid__row">
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-one-fourth">1/4</div>
        <div className="ds-grid__column width-three-fourths">3/4</div>
      </div>
    </div>
```

### Element Spacing & Positioning

#### Spacing
`spacing-{size}`

You can add padding in the following size ranges to your elements by adding a spacing modifier:

|   Size   |   Pixels  |
|----------|-----------|
| s        | `8px`     |
| m        | `16px`    |
| l        | `24px`    |

**Apply small padding to every element in the grid:**
```js
  <div class="ds-grid spacing-s">
    ...
  </div>
```

By default, all grid children will inherit padding from the global padding modifier. You may override any container's padding by adding a `spacing-{size}` modifier to the element itself.

This grid has large padding applied to all elements except the second column in the first row (which now has small padding):
```js
  <div class="ds-grid spacing-l">
    <div class="ds-grid__row">
      <div class="ds-grid__col"></div>
      <div class="ds-grid__col spacing-s"></div>
      <div class="ds-grid__col"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
```
#### Content Positioning

`align-{position}` & `justify-{position}`

Column content positions at the top-left of the container by default, but it's easy to define positioning by adding one of the above modifiers.


**Bottom of the column:**
```js
  <div class="ds-grid spacing-l">
    <div class="ds-grid__row">
      <div class="ds-grid__col align-end">I go at the bottom</div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

**Right side of the column:**
```js
  <div class="ds-grid spacing-l">
    <div class="ds-grid__row">
      <div class="ds-grid__col justify-end">Right-justified</div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

**Center vertically and horizontally:**
```js
  <div class="ds-grid spacing-l">
    <div class="ds-grid__row">
      <div class="ds-grid__col align-center justify-center">Dead center!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
```
